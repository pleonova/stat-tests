# Flow Chart for Statistical Tests

## Summary 
This flow chart helps you choose the right statistical test to evaluate your experiments based on the type of data you have, its underlying distribution and assumptions as well as the number of groups and confounding variables you are testing.

## Navigating the Chart

On the top left you will find the most common decision points throughout the chart, so gaining familarity and understanding of these assumptions and knowing where your data fits is important in navigating the flow chart.

On the bottom, you'll find additional notes/formulas to help you learn more about each of the tests and some notable differences/similarities between other tests. I've also included some examples to make some of the tests more concrete.  

The color coding helps to group similar tests and the different outlines call out parallel tests, but under different assumptions.

Resources and helpful links are included both in the bottom text boxes as well as on the right hand side, where there is a whole section that lists useful references such as online courses and textbooks.
